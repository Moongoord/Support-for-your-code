# Contributing to MetaTrader Gateway Support

Thank you for your interest in helping the community! This guide explains how you can contribute to making this support repository better.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Answer Questions

Help other developers by answering questions in [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions).

**Good answers include:**
- Clear explanations
- Code examples
- References to documentation
- Personal experience and tips

**Example:**
```
I had the same issue! The problem is that you need to normalize
the lot size to your broker's step.

Try this:

```python
lot_step = symbol_info.volume_step
lots = round(lots / lot_step) * lot_step
```

This worked for me on [Broker Name].
```

Title: How to handle "Invalid stops" error when placing orders?

I'm trying to place a buy order with stop loss but getting error 130
(Invalid stops).

My code (Python):
```python
order = client.order_send(
    symbol="EURUSD",
    volume=0.1,
    type=ORDER_TYPE_BUY,
    price=1.0850,
    sl=1.0840,  # 10 pips stop loss
    tp=1.0870
)
```

Error: ERR_INVALID_STOPS (130)

Environment:
- Python 3.11

I've tried increasing the stop loss distance but still get the error.
